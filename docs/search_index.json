Then one question remains, which is, that what factor on earth, in a macro perspective，say，the GDP or the Life Span Expectancy, shapes peoples recognition of happiness. Also, it is natural to further consider how people’s thoughts have changed over the past years. Is the life better or worse than years ago? Besides the subjective evaluation from every single person, we would also look at the external factors that have affected the happiness score performance. The lifestyle or culture generally varies from continent to continent, and the GDP also determines the development level for a country. Then, there should be some correlation between happiness score and continent/development level, and this correlation is await us to be solved. Moreover, we shall never neglect the influence of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has been the most consequential global event in the past few years, and it inevitably brings impact on every facet of life. Our misison is to explore the COVID-19 impact on the happiness score, whether it is good or bad, happy or sad. In this project, we gather life ladder data and other objective descriptions of a country’s welfare data mainly from the World Health Organization website. It includes data across the world over the past years, from 2008 to 2020. We will focus on visualizing the score changing trend and distribution among the world, as well as carrying out practical analysis about how COVID-19 has reshaped people’s recognition of happiness. To be more specific, we are going to explore the data both in time and in geographic perspectives, and figure out what aspect affects people’s feelings about happiness. Meanwhile, we shall also concentrate on the impact that COVID-19 brings to life. We will answer the following questions step by step in this project: What is the most important factor affecting the life ladder (i.e., the happiness score)? What about other factors? What is the trend of the life ladder? Would it be different across continents/development levels? How can we classify the countries by the trend? How did COVID-19 affect the life ladder? Would it be different across continents/development levels? In the next chapters, we will discuss the above questions in depth with direct visualizations.

Num of observations 142 We start with a subset of our data, the year 2018, to analyze missing patterns. Notice the data set has 25 variables and 142 observations. 4.2 Explore Missing Patterns ## GINI.idx Trust.G Trust.81.84 Trust.89.93 Trust.99.04 Trust.94.98 ## 142 142 132 124 102 91 ## Trust.05.09 Trust.10.14 Conf GINI.00.17 Perc Log.GDP ## 90 89 15 11 8 5 ## Generosity Life.exp gini.hhold Posi Nega Freedom ## 5 4 3 2 2 1 ## Democratic Delivery year Life Social.sup ladder.sig ## 1 1 0 0 0 0 ## ladder.m ## 0 “Gini index” and “Trust of Gallup” are missing for all observations. It is possible that these columns are placeholders saved for future use. We notice that a large percentage of observations are missing the “Trust” data (i.e., “Most people can be trusted”). These are survey data collected by GWP and it is noted in our source’s appendix that “this indicator has a limited coverage”, which makes sense since survey data is hard to be gathered all over the world. We also find that the number of missing “Trust” data is decreasing over time. We think this is a sign that with the development of technology, this survey is carried in more countries. As for “Average Gini between 2000 and 2017”, countries missing this indicator are usually those still in a state of war or instability, such as Afghanistan and Libya. So it is difficult to collect data. And “Confidence in government” is another survey data from GWP. Missing this variable may be due to political and religious reasons (e.g., China, Libya). We found 51 missing patterns. And from the patterns we observe that: The most representative one is the first pattern where all six of “Most People can be trusted” variables, as well as “Gini index” and “Trust of Gallup” are missing. Over 25% of observations are of this pattern. It’s clear from the graph that many patterns emerge because of different levels of missing the six “Trust” survey data. “Log of GDP” and “Generosity quality” are always missing at the same time. For several patterns, “Confidence in government” and “Perception of Corruption” are missing at the same time. Another interesting insight is that there is no observation missing “average Gini between 2000 and 2017” and “Gini of household income” at the same time. 4.3 Summary Based on the above analysis, we definitely should drop the “Gini index” and “Trust of Gallup” columns since these are essentially empty columns. As for the six “Trust” columns, there are two reasons why we should also drop them. First, even the most complete pattern would have over 50% missing in “Trust”, so the information provided is very limited. Second, it shows a clear decreasing pattern of missing percentage for the “Trust” column as time goes by, but it is difficult for us to judge whether the survey standards of the questionnaire are consistent, so these columns may even provide noise or misleading information.
